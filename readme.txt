Use any image in your WordPress Media Libary as a custom user avatar.

== Description ==

WordPress currently only allows you to use custom avatars that are uploaded through gravatar.com. WP User Avatar enables you to use any photo uploaded into your Media Library as an avatar. This means you use the same uploader and library as your posts. No extra folders or image editing functions are necessary.

To use WP User Avatar in your theme, manually replace <code>get_avatar()</code> with <code>get_wp_user_avatar()</code> or leave <code>get_avatar()</code> as-is. <code>get_wp_user_avatar()</code> has  functionality not available in <code>get_avatar()</code>. You can also use the shortcode <code>[avatar]</code> in your posts.

This plugin uses the new Media Uploader introduced in WordPress 3.5, but is also backwards-compatible to WordPress 3.0.

== Installation ==

1. Download, install, and activate the WP User Avatar plugin.
2. On your edit profile page, click "Edit WP User Avatar".
3. Choose an image, then click "Set WP User Avatar".
4. Click "Update Profile".
5. In your theme, manually replace <code>get_avatar()</code> with <code>get_wp_user_avatar()</code> or leave <code>get_avatar()</code> as-is.
6. You can also use the shortcode <code>[avatar]</code> in your posts.

**Example Usage**

Within The Loop, you may be using:

`<?php echo get_avatar(get_the_author_meta('ID'), 96); ?>`

Replace this function with:

`<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar(get_the_author_meta('ID'), 96); ?>`

You can also use the values "original", "large", "medium", or "thumbnail" for your avatar size:

`<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar(get_the_author_meta('ID'), 'medium'); ?>`

You can also add an alignment of "left", "right", or "center":

`<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar(get_the_author_meta('ID'), 96, 'left'); ?>`

On an author page outside of The Loop, you may be using:

`<?php
  $user = get_user_by('slug', $author_name); 
  echo get_avatar($user->ID, 96);
?>`

Replace this function with:

`<?php
  $user = get_user_by('slug', $author_name);
  echo get_wp_user_avatar($user->ID, 96);
?>`

If you leave the options blank, WP User Avatar will detect whether you're inside The Loop or on an author page and return the correct avatar in the default 96x96 size:

`<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar(); ?>`

The function <code>get_wp_user_avatar()</code> will also fall back to <code>get_avatar()</code> if no WP User Avatar image is set. For this to work, "Show Avatars" must be checked in your Discussion settings.

**Other Available Functions**

= [avatar] shortcode =

You can use the shortcode <code>[avatar]</code> in your posts. It will detect the author of the post or you can specify an author by username. You can specify a size and alignment, but they are optional.

`[avatar user="admin" size="medium" align="left"]`

= get_wp_user_avatar_src() =

Works just like <code>get_wp_user_avatar()</code> but returns just the image src. This is useful if you would like to link a thumbnail-sized avatar to a larger version of the image:

`<a href="<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar_src($user_id, 'large'); ?>">
  <?php echo get_wp_user_avatar($user_id, 'thumbnail'); ?>
</a>`

= has_wp_user_avatar() =

Returns true if the user has a WP User Avatar image. You can specify the user ID, or leave it blank to detect the author within The Loop or author page:

`<?php
  if ( has_wp_user_avatar($user_id) ) {
    echo get_wp_user_avatar($user_id, 96);
  } else {
    echo '<img src="my-alternate-image.jpg" />';
  }
?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use WP User Avatar? =

You have a choice of manually replacing <code>get_avatar()</code> with <code>get_wp_user_avatar()</code> in your theme, or leaving <code>get_avatar()</code> as-is. Here are the differences:

= get_wp_user_avatar() =

1. Allows you to use the values "original", "large", "medium", or "thumbnail" for your avatar size.
2. Doesn't add a fixed width and height to the image if you use the aforementioned values. This will give you more flexibility to resize the image with CSS.
3. Optionally adds CSS classes "alignleft", "alignright", or "aligncenter" to position your avatar.
4. Shows nothing if no WP User Avatar image is set.
5. Shows the default avatar only if "Show Avatars" is enabled in your Discussion settings.

= get_avatar() =

1. Requires you to enable "Show Avatars" in your Discussion settings to show any avatars.
2. Accepts only numeric values for your avatar size.
3. Always adds a fixed width and height to your image. This may cause problems if you use responsive CSS in your theme.
4. Shows the default avatar if no WP User Avatar image is set. (Choosing "Blank" still generates a transparent image file.)
5. Requires no changes to your theme files if you are currently using <code>get_avatar()</code>.

= How can I see which users have an avatar? =

For administrators, WP User Avatar adds a column with avatar thumbnails to your Users admin table. If "Show Avatars" is enabled in your Discussion settings, you will see avatars to the left of each username instead of in a new column.

= Will WP User Avatar work with comment author avatars? =

Yes, for registered users. Non-registered comment authors will show their gravatar.com avatars.

= Can I insert WP User Avatar directly into a post? =

You can use the shortcode <code>[avatar]</code> in your posts. It will detect the author of the post or you can specify an author by username. You can specify a size or alignment, but they are optional.

`[avatar user="admin" size="medium" align="left"]`

= What CSS can I use with WP User Avatar? =

WP User Avatar will add the CSS classes "wp-user-avatar" and "wp-user-avatar-{size}" to your image. If you add an alignment, the corresponding alignment class will be added:

`<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar($user_id, 96, 'left'); ?>`

Outputs:

`<img src="{imageURL}" width="96" height="96" class="wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-96 alignleft" />`

If you use the values "original", "large", "medium", or "thumbnail", no width or height will be added to the image. This will give you more flexibility to resize the image with CSS:

`<?php echo get_wp_user_avatar($user_id, 'medium'); ?>`

Outputs:

`<img src="{imageURL}" class="wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-medium" />`

**Note:** WordPress adds more CSS classes to the avater not listed here.
